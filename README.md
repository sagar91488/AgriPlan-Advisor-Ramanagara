 üåæ AgriPlan Advisor ‚Äì Ramanagara District Prototype
AgriPlan Advisor is a district-level crop planning support tool designed specifically for farmers in Ramanagara, Karnataka. The aim is to help farmers make better-informed crop selection decisions before planting, based on real-time crop trend data and price prediction logic.

In many regions, farmers often end up growing the same crops due to lack of information, leading to market saturation and lower profits. AgriPlan Advisor solves this by collecting live data from users (farmers) about their crop choices and displaying percentage-based analytics. This helps each user understand how many others are planning the same crop, so they can choose crops that are less cultivated for better profitability.

üîç Key Features:
District-focused insights for Ramanagara.

Real-time crop popularity tracking (e.g., Reshme, Tomato, Ragi, Banana, Cow farming, etc.).

Price prediction engine estimating potential selling price after 2‚Äì3 months.

Multi-user updates ‚Äì data is stored and updated collaboratively.

Trend-based crop suggestion for users to pick less-grown crops.

15-day data snapshots for historical trend analysis.

Simple, clean Flask-based web interface for user-friendly interaction.

The platform uses Python (Flask) for backend logic, Firebase Realtime Database for storing and syncing user data, and HTML/CSS for the frontend. The data is anonymized and stored securely, with each entry contributing to an evolving trend report accessible to all users.

This project is a prototype, currently limited to Ramanagara district, but it can easily be scaled to cover all districts in Karnataka or even other states. The design promotes collaborative farming decisions, early risk avoidance, and price awareness, ultimately empowering farmers through technology.

Whether you're a farmer, agricultural officer, or data enthusiast, AgriPlan Advisor provides a smart way to bridge the gap between farming and real-time data intelligence.
